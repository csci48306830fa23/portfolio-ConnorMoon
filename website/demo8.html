            <p>This is the eighth VR demo. It demonstrates many different features learned from the previous demos. The first is an avatar and its animated hands when grabbing an object. The second is a GUI that loads a new scene that shows off an alternative way of dealing with the avatar. The third is an incorporated mirror. The fourth is imported FBX models that I created from scratch in Blender. These objects are VR interactable and have an additional feature attached to them. </p>
