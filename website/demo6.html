            <p>This is the sixth VR demo. It demonstrates three different features within Unity. The first is the changing of GUIs when navigating them. So pressing a button can show a new set of buttons and texts. The second feature is the changing of scenes and loading them due to an action. The third feature is the use of skyboxes. Altogether this demo is a good way to learn more about building a unique menu screen that can load specific levels.</p>
